          "title": "French Alphabet",
          "explanation": "The French alphabet contains 26 letters, just like English. However, pronunciation differs for many. For example, 'C' before 'e' or 'i' sounds like 'S', while 'G' before the same letters sounds like 'J'. Pronunciation is crucial in French. For example, many consonants at the end of words are silent. Letters like 'e', 'é', 'è', and 'ê' have distinct sounds that change word meanings.",
          "example": "Cé (C), Jé (G), Commencer (sounds like Kom-on-say); Ex: 'père' (father), 'pair' (peer), 'paix' (peace)"
        },
        {
          "title": "Vowels and Consonants",
          "explanation": "There are six vowels in French (a, e, i, o, u, y), and the letter 'h' is usually silent. Vowels can have different sounds depending on accents and combinations.",
          "example": "hôtel = [O-T-E], garçon = [Gar-son]"

      "topic": "Subject Pronouns",
      "lessons": [
        {
          "title": "French Subject Pronouns",
          "explanation": "French uses different pronouns based on number (singular/plural) and person (1st, 2nd, 3rd). 'Je' is 'I', 'Tu' is informal 'you', and 'Vous' is formal or plural 'you'. These pronouns replace the subject of a sentence and are essential for verb conjugation. French verbs change depending on the subject pronoun.",
          "example": "Je parle (I speak), Tu écoutes (You listen), Vous êtes (You are); Ex: Nous allons au marché (We are going to the market)"
        },
        {
          "title": "Tu vs Vous",
          "explanation": "Use 'tu' for friends, family, children; use 'vous' for formal situations or groups. Misusing can seem disrespectful. This distinction reflects levels of familiarity and politeness in French culture. 'Vous' is also used for one person in formal situations.",
          "example": "Tu es gentil (You're kind - informal), Vous êtes gentil (You're kind - formal); Ex: Vous travaillez ici? (Do you work here? - formal)"

      "lessons": [
        {
          "title": "Definite Articles",
          "explanation": "French has four definite articles: 'le' (masculine), 'la' (feminine), 'l'' (before vowel or mute h), and 'les' (plural). They agree with the noun in gender and number. Articles must agree with gender (masculine/feminine) and number (singular/plural). Use 'l'' before vowels to ease pronunciation.",
          "example": "le livre (the book), la maison (the house), l'école (the school), les enfants (the children); Ex: l'homme (the man), l'amie (the friend)"
        },
        {
          "title": "Indefinite Articles",
          "explanation": "Indefinite articles are: 'un' (masculine), 'une' (feminine), and 'des' (plural). Used for unspecified nouns. These articles indicate non-specific nouns. They are used similarly to 'a', 'an', and 'some' in English. Gender agreement is crucial.",
          "example": "un garçon (a boy), une fille (a girl), des amis (some friends); Ex: un arbre (a tree), une orange (an orange), des livres (some books)"

        {
          "title": "Regular -ER Verbs",
          "explanation": "Remove '-er' and add: -e, -es, -e, -ons, -ez, -ent for je, tu, il/elle, nous, vous, ils/elles respectively. -ER verbs are the most common in French. After removing -er, attach the appropriate endings based on the subject.",
          "example": "Je parle, tu parles, il parle, nous parlons, vous parlez, ils parlent; Ex: travailler → je travaille, tu travailles"
        },
        {
          "title": "Irregular Verbs: Être & Avoir",
          "explanation": "'Être' means 'to be', 'avoir' means 'to have'. These are irregular and used in many expressions and compound tenses. Être and Avoir are foundational verbs in French. They are used not only for their literal meanings but also to form compound tenses like passé composé.",
          "example": "Je suis (I am), Tu es (You are), J'ai (I have), Tu as (You have); Ex: Il est fatigué (He is tired), Nous avons une voiture (We have a car)"

        {
          "title": "Common Greetings",
          "explanation": "Learn formal and informal ways to greet, say goodbye, and express politeness. Greetings vary by formality and time of day. 'Bonsoir' is used in the evening. French also emphasizes politeness through language.",
          "example": "Bonjour (Good morning), Salut (Hi), Merci (Thank you), Au revoir (Goodbye); Ex: Bonsoir (Good evening), Enchanté (Nice to meet you)"
        },
        {
          "title": "Introducing Yourself",
          "explanation": "To introduce yourself, say: 'Je m'appelle ___'. For asking others, use: 'Comment tu t'appelles?' (informal) or 'Comment vous appelez-vous?' (formal). French introductions often use reflexive constructions. Knowing both formal and informal versions is key in social contexts.",
          "example": "Je m'appelle Marie. Comment vous appelez-vous?; Ex: Je m'appelle Jean. Et toi?"
